# Resource dependency in Terraform allows you to specify the order in which resources are created or destroyed. This is useful when one resource depends on the existence of another resource.

# Terraform resource dependency example
# This example demonstrates how to create a dependency between two resources in Terraform.

# resource "aws_instance" "example" {
#   ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
#   instance_type = "t2.micro"

#   tags = {
#     Name = "MyEC2Instance"
#   }
# }

# resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
#   bucket = "my-example-bucket"

#   # This resource depends on the aws_instance resource being created first
#   depends_on = [aws_instance.example]

#   tags = {
#     Name = "MyS3Bucket"
#   }
# }
