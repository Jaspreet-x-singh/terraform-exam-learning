# terraform pre-conditions and post-conditions are features that allow you to define conditions that must be met before or after a resource is created, updated, or destroyed. These conditions can be used to enforce certain rules or constraints on the resources in your Terraform configuration.

# Example of using pre-conditions in a resource definition:
# variable "instance_type" {
#   type        = string
#   description = "The type of instance to create"
#   default     = "t2.micro"
# }

# resource "aws_instance" "example" {
#   ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
#   instance_type = var.instance_type

#   # Pre-condition: Ensure that the instance type is valid before creating the resource
#   lifecycle {
#     precondition {
#       condition     = contains(["t2.micro", "t2.small", "t2.medium"], var.instance_type)
#       error_message = "The instance_type must be one of 't2.micro', 't2.small', or 't2.medium'."
#     }
#   }

#   tags = {
#     Name = "MyEC2Instance"
#   }
# }

# resource "aws_instance_type" "example" {
#   instance_type = var.instance_type
#   ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"

#   # Pre-condition: Ensure that the instance type is valid before creating the resource
#   lifecycle {
#     precondition {
#       condition     = data.aws_instance_type.example.free_tier_eligible == true
#       error_message = "The instance_type must be eligible for the free tier."
#     }
#     postcondition {
#       condition     = data.aws_instance_type.example.public_ip == true
#       error_message = "The instance_type must have a public IP address."
#     }
#   }
# }

# # Example of using post-conditions in a resource definition:
# resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
#   bucket = "my-example-bucket"

#   # Post-condition: Ensure that the bucket name is unique after creating the resource
#   lifecycle {
#     postcondition {
#       condition     = length(aws_s3_bucket.example.bucket) > 0
#       error_message = "The S3 bucket name must be unique and not empty."
#     }
#   }

#   tags = {
#     Name = "MyS3Bucket"
#   }
# }
